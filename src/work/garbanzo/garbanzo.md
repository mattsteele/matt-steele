Garbanzo is a Colorado-based fast casual restaurant chain that was looking to boost sales through a whole new re-branding and marketing campaign. Working with Art Director Jon Lambert, we completely rebuilt their web presence giving it a fresh new look and boosting web traffic.

Garbanzo’s old website didn’t reflect the great, healthy food that the chain offers. It was also built on an outdated WordPress theme that simply didn’t work on mobile.

I worked to build their new site from the ground up, giving them a 100% custom experience that a restaurant deserves. Garbanzo’s new website is completely responsive and allows customers to check out the menu and even order online directly from their phones.

## Integration
